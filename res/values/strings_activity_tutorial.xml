    <string name="quick_lock_option">Automaton mainly uses 4 Sensors for <b>Locking &amp; Unlocking</b> device</string>
    <string name="quick_lock_list">
        \n\n1. <b>Proximity</b>:\nWidely used for locking &amp; unlocking device using Flip Cover also works best with Pocket Mode
        \n\n2. <b>Light</b>:\nMainly for Tablets as they have Light sensor currently making it work like Proximity Sensor
        \n\n3. <b>Shake</b>:\nJust Shake your phone to lock &amp; unlock your device
        \n\n4. <b>Fuse: Proximity &amp; Shake</b>:\nFor Flip Cover &amp; Pocket Mode
        \n<u>To Lock</u> - The proximity sensor should be cover &amp; then device should be shaked
        \n<u>To Unlock</u> - The proximity sensor should be uncovered &amp; then device should be shaked
        \n\n5. <b>Magnetic - Flip Cover</b>:\nInnovative mode only in <b>Automaton</b> to make it work with your Magnetic Flip Covers
        \n<u>Note:</u>Calibrate the Magnetic Sensor required for your Magnetic Flip Cover
        \n\n6. <b>Fuse: Magnetic &amp; Proximity - Accurate &amp; Advance Flip Cover Mode</b>:
        \nWorks same as Magnetic Flip Cover Mode, just taking it to highest accuracy.Here, The Proximity sensor is specially used to confirm lock-unlock device
        \n\n7. <b>Split: Proximity | Shake</b>:\nUsing this you can lock or unlock using both the sensors independently i.e you can shake for unlock &amp; open cover for unlock too
        \n\n8. <b>Fuse + Split:  Proximity &amp; Shake | Proximity</b>:\nMy personal favorite Pocket Mode in which both the concepts are merge to give you excellent experience.
        \nYou can set Proximity &amp; Shake some different job &amp; Proximity after \'|\' some different job 
        \n<u>Special Feature of Split</u>: You can set different functions for both of the sensors using Split 2nd Sensor Function in Control Panel</string>

    <string name="quick_combination">Automaton provides 2 sensor concepts</string>
    <string name="quick_combination_taunt">
        1. <b>Fusion Concept (Fuse)</b>:\nGives possibility to combine two sensors values &amp; then determines to lock/unlock
        \n<u>Ex.</u>Consider, your using Proximity &amp; Shake then:
        \n<u>To Lock</u> - The proximity sensor should be cover &amp; then device should be shaked
        \n<u>To Unlock</u> - The proximity sensor should be uncovered &amp; then device should be shaked
        \n\n2. <b>Fission Concept (Split)</b>:\nSensors can be given different job instead of combining their effect like in Fuse
        \nBoth the sensors can be set different sensor function as per your requirements
        \n<u>Ex.</u>When using Shake | Proximity you can set Shake to Lock &amp; Proximity to Unlock
        \n<u>Special Feature of Split</u>: You can set different functions for both of the sensors using Split 2nd Sensor Function in Control Panel</string>
    
    <string name="quick_feature_title">Intuitive features of app are :</string>
    
    <string name="quick_feature_summary">\n1. <b>Ignore App List</b> :\nSelect the app for which my app will not disturb for preventing accidental lock while playing game
        \n\n2. <b>Night Mode</b> :\nApp stops during that time interval selected useful during Night
        \n\n3. <b>Calibrating</b> :\nSensors can be calibrate means you can adjust the sensors default values for locking &amp; unlocking bringing comfort according to your needs
        \n\n4. <b>Custom ROM support</b> :\nAutomaton works fluidly on Custom ROMs too &amp; also provides an option to apply special custom ROM tweaks during first start up
        \n\nLot more features..</string>
